# Introduction to Neural Networks

This repository contains the code and Colab notebooks for the Epoch "Introduction to Neural Networks" intersession, led by Ethan Haque and Dev Singh. 

While these notebooks may run on environments outside of Colab, they do use some specific Colab libraries. Therefore, it is reccomended to use Colab to run these notebooks. Any notebooks that have architectures which greatly benefit from GPU acceleration have GPU acceleration enabled in the notebooks.
